# Fashion-MNIST

This document presents an application of a neural network for image classification problems. This work is part
of my experiments with the Fashion-MNIST dataset using various machine learning algorithms and models. Our aim
is to predict different fashion products from the given images using various Machine Learning Models and compare
their results to find out the best ML model.
